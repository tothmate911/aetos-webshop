# aetos-webshop

This is the backend of a webshop, that I am currently working on.

It is written in Java, using Spring framework.

The datas of users, products, payments are stored in a PostgreSQL database using Hibernate.

I use Spring Security and JWT tokens for user authentication.

I use JUnit tests and Mockito for testing.
